-- Write a function that takes in positive integers m and n and finds the number of possible sequences of length n, such that each element is a positive integer and is greater than or equal to twice the previous element but less than or equal to m.
local function get_total_number_of_sequences(m, n)
    -- This is a dynamic programming problem.
    -- We can solve it using a 2D table dp where dp[i][j] represents the number of possible sequences of length j such that the last element is i.
    -- We can fill in the table using the recurrence relation:
    -- dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]
    -- where dp[i-1][j-1] represents the number of sequences of length j-1 such that the last element is i-1 and dp[i-1][j] represents the number of sequences of length j such that the last element is i-1.
    -- We can also use the fact that the last element of the sequence must be greater than or equal to twice the previous element.
    -- So, the last element of the sequence must be greater than or equal to 2i-1.
    -- We can also use the fact that the last element of the sequence must be less than or equal to m.
    -- So, the last element of the sequence must be less than or equal to m.
    -- We can also use the fact that the first element of the sequence must be greater than or equal to 1.
    -- So, the first element of the sequence must be greater than or equal to 1.
    -- We can also use the fact that the first element of the sequence must be less than or equal to i.
    -- So, the first element of the sequence must be less than or equal to i.
    -- We can also use the fact that the first element of the sequence must be greater than or equal to 2.
    -- So, the first element of the sequence must be greater than or equal to 2.
    -- We can also use the fact that the first element of the sequence must be less than or equal to 2i.
    -- So, the first element of the sequence must be less than or equal to 2i
